# Re-Frame Exercise  <!-- omit in toc -->

Check my blog [Clojure Re-Frame Exercise](https://www.karimarttila.fi/clojure/2020/10/15/clojure-re-frame-exercise.html) for the documentation of this re-frame exercise.

## Calva instructions

`just frontend` ... and wait until you see `build completed`. (I.e. you don't have to start the backend REPL since Calva uses the JVM process shadow-cljs starts.)

In VSCode/Calva: `Connect to a running repl server in the project` => `backend + frontend` . You are good to go.
